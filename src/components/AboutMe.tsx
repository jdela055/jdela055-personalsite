                    Welcome to my humble little React Native site! ðŸ˜Ž
                    I hope you like the colors, my partner helped me pick them :) and the photo of my dog :) His name is Chewie and he's really cool and I love him :) He's wearing a crown in the photo because it was his birthday :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site is a work in progress, I'll keep updating it over time. *note to self: figure out how to make text changes without needing to re-deploy the site*                  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ 
                    I'm like looking for a job or something so it sure would be nice and cool if a super cool employer went onto this here site and decided to give me a job :)
                </p>
